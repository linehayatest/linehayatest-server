    * **Action**
        * Tell Student that chat request is accepted.

## Note
* Every change in Volunteer States result in updates to all volunteers.

* Every change in Student waiting state result in updates to all volunteers.

* Every change in Student chat state (active -> disconnect, disconnect -> active) doesn't result in updates to all volunteers, but only to the connected volunteer.

* When Student state changes to offline, ConnectedTo volunteer state will also change from Active/Disconnect -> Free. This will update all volunteers.

## Danger
When notifying all volunteers, some volunteers could potentially in disconnect.
    * Skip notifying these volunteers.

When volunteer reconnects without passing timeout duration, rese

## Edge cases
* Student reconnects but already time out
    * Use GET endpoint to handle, sends a request to server to reconnect
    * If can reconnect & Volunteer Disconnects or Active, setup a RECONNECT socket connection
    * If can reconnect & Volunteer ends conversation, tell Student to get in waiting list again because Volunteer already ended conversation
    * If cannot reconnect (timeout), tell Student to get in waiting list again

* How to handle, when volunteer disconnects when free?
    * Socket would error on read.
    * If we emit "disconnect" event (normally, as we handle disconnects when chat), we need to:
        * notify the connected student
            * If cannot be found from connected list, we simply skip
        * set socket to null
        * notify all volunteers, then wait timeout
    * âœ… Or we could handle it separately by deleting the volunteer from database
        * `if v.fsm.Is("free") socket.Close; volunteers.Remove("email");`


# Endpoints
* GET: Volunteer permission to login
